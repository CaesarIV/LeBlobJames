# LeBlobJames

### Current Implementation:

- [x] Blob-like
- [x] Finds all food sources
- [ ] Add your own ya G!

### TODO:

- [x]  **Is the evolved (optimized) leblob DNA good for other targets?** In other words if you use the final product directly without re-evolving, will it work with another target? If yes then the solution is  generalized .. If No the solution is specific to target and we need to generalize it more.

- [x] Although we evaluate neighboring cells in a shuffled way ... we evaluate all cells in order i.e. rows the cols (we need to **shuffle** that too, in order **to** **prevent any biases** because of this) ... the current situation gives priority of occupying space to the top left cells.

- [ ] After these are done ... I need a **complex target system** ... food needs to get consumed and move/spawn to new areas ... I need a dynamic target.

- [ ] Need to apply a **Sharpe ratio** like objective function.

- [x] Need to diffuse energy / food through the cells ie transport the food in the organism this way it has to have connection line. STILL NO CONNECTION LINES!

- [x] Need to add the ability of cells to move around in semi random way.
